# 6-1 Create Project Poster

Your team will participate in a poster presentation to demonstrate and explain your project to a public audience. The poster presentation will be like a game convention, where you are pitching your game design and demonstrating your digital prototype.

Your team needs to create a poster that helps describe your game and how your team researched, designed, prototyped, and evaluated it. The poster will be a visual reference to supplement the in-person explanation and demonstration that your team gives during the presentation event.

The poster should be clear, concise, engaging, and professional.

Your team's poster should briefly describe or show:

* Game Title
* Targeted Gaming Motivations and Player Experience Goals
* Summary of Game Concept
  * Game's Premise and Setting
  * Game's Characters and Story \(if applicable\)
  * Game's Objective and Conflict/Challenge
  * Basic Gameplay and Gameplay Progression
* Summary of Process used to Research, Design, Prototype, and Evaluate Game
* Names and Roles of Team Members

Be sure to incorporate images into your poster, possibly including:

* Target Player Persona
* Concept Sketches for Game
* Photos of Paper Prototype
* Completed Game Art, such as Character Sprites, etc.
* Screenshots of Game
* Examples of Game Code

The standard size for a large poster is 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall. Your teacher will assist with getting the posters printed.

## YOUR TASK

1. **Gather the content** \(text and images\) for your team’s project poster.
   * You should be able to use or edit content from your team's game design document and/or marketing website \(but don't necessarily create a poster replica of the website\).
   * Think about ways to use the content of your poster to support or supplement your verbal presentation.
     * The poster won't necessarily include everything about your project — but the poster should have enough information to make sense if someone were to only look at your poster.
   * Be sure the content is clear, concise, engaging, and professional.
2. **Determine the layout and style** for your team's poster.
   * Sketch one or more possible layouts for the poster content. You can use a standard sheet of paper to sketch a simplified, small-scale mockup.
   * Decide on the overall style for the poster \(such as: fonts, colors, etc.\).
   * Be sure the layout and style of the content will be clear, engaging, and professional.
3. **Create a digital version of your poster**.
   * You can use this [Google Drawing template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KylT3n3jW1WH98jlbo0yq28rXNeSTyzUOBl1itA9f4s) which is preset to 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall
     * Be sure you're logged in to your Google Account. From the **File** menu, select **Make a copy**. Save the copied file to your shared team folder in Google Drive.
     * Zoom in or out as needed to add and edit text, images, etc., but do not change the canvas size. \(Otherwise, your digital poster proportions might not match the printed poster size\).
   * Be sure your poster doesn't have too much text \(people might not read it all\) or too little text \(people might not understand the poster\). For example, certain images may need a caption to be clear.
   * Be sure you have strong contrast between text color and its background color.
     * If the background is **dark**, the text should be **light**.
     * If the background is **light**, the text should be **dark**.
   * Be sure the font types, font styles, and font sizes used on the poster will allow people to easily read the text from several feet away.
     * Fancy fonts may be harder to read. Limit fancy fonts to short text \(such as titles or headings\). Use simple fonts for longer text.
     * Small font sizes \(e.g., less than 36\) may be harder to read from several feet away.
4. **Have a physical poster printed**.
   * Save or download a copy of your poster as a PDF for printing.
   * Be sure the PDF has a filename that clearly identifies your class period and team.
   * Provide the PDF to your teacher for printing.
