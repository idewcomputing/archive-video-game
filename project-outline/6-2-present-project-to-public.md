# 6-2 Present Project to Public

The audience attending the public presentation will walk around and spend a few minutes with different teams to learn about their project. You will most likely have to present and demonstrate your project multiple times to various small groups of people.

## YOUR TASK

1. **Prepare and practice a verbal presentation** that describes the problem your team targeted and explains/demonstrates the solution you created.
   * Have a short "pitch" \(less than 3 minutes\) that you can use to engage and educate audience members.
   * For audience members that are interested in learning more, be prepared to explain your game in more detail and how you researched, designed, developed, and evaluated it.
   * Think about ways to use your poster, game, and verbal presentation to supplement each other.
   * Each team member should be prepared to help present as needed.
2. **For the day of the event, be sure you have the following:**
   * Your team's project poster
   * Internet-connected computer \(to demonstrate your game and show your marketing website\)
   * **OPTIONAL:** Any other materials that your team may want to use in its presentation \(such as concept art, paper prototype, etc.\)
3. **During the presentation:**
   * Be friendly, confident, and engaging. Treat every audience member as a potential judge \(because some of them might be judges\).
   * Be sure to give audience members an opportunity to play your game.
   * Be prepared to respond to questions from the audience members.
   * Be respectful of your audience's time â€” they also want to see other team's projects during the event.
