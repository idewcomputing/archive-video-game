# 2-5 Evaluate Game Treatments

Your team needs to gather outside feedback on your game treatments. The feedback will be used to help decide which game concept to prototype and what design improvements it might need.

The teams in the class will pair up to provide feedback on each other's game treatments through a design critique.

## 5 Tips for Giving Feedback

1. Keep the design goals in mind when reviewing work.
2. Ask questions to better understand the design and to spark thinking about possible opportunities for improvements.
3. Make sure feedback is objective and specific — and explain the reasons for the feedback.
4. Be sure to identify what works well — as well as what could be improved.
5. The purpose is help improve the design, so it will better meet the design goals.

## 5 Tips for Receiving Feedback

1. Be sure the design goals are presented along with the design work.
2. Be prepared to answer questions and to explain your design thinking.
3. Listen — keep an open mind, don't take feedback personally, and don't get defensive.
4. Ask your own questions to clarify feedback or to get feedback on specific items.
5. Take notes, so you can follow up on feedback later.

## YOUR TASK

1. Teams should pair up, in order to provide feedback on each other's game treatments.
2. Critique one game treatment at a time \(about 10 minutes per game treatment\):
   * The reviewers have 3-4 minutes to read and think about the game treatment.
   * The reviewers then have 5-7 minutes to provide feedback and ask questions.
   * During this time, the design team can respond and can ask follow-up questions.
   * The design team should have someone recording notes on the feedback.
3. Then the teams switch roles to review the next game treatment. Repeat until all game treatments for both teams have been reviewed.
4. Your team should used the review feedback to help evaluate the game treatments, in order to select one game concept that your team will prototype for its project.
