# 1-1 Determine Gamer Motivation Profile

## What types of video games do you like to play?

Just as people like different types of books or movies, people like different types of video games. If you're going to design a video game, you'll need to know more about what motivates people to play certain games.

You'll start by taking a survey to determine your own Gamer Motivation Profile. Later in the project, each team will decide what gamer motivations their game will target.

[Quantic Foundry](http://quanticfoundry.com/) is a game analytics consulting company that has gathered data from over 300,000 video game players to construct a scientific model that describes different types of gamer motivations.

This model identified 12 motivations that clustered into 6 pair groups: Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement, Immersion, and Creativity. For example, _Challenge_ and _Strategy_ are motivations that belong to the _Mastery_ group.

**VIDEO:** This gamer motivation model was constructed using a statistical method called factor analysis. If you're interested, Quantic Foundry has a [video explaining how this model was built](https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZwiQd-0xqQ?start=0&end=380) using survey data collected from thousands of video game players.
