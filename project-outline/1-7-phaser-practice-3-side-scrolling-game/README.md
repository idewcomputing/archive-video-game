# 1-7 Phaser Practice 3: Side-Scrolling Game

In this third practice, you're going to create a side-scrolling game that follows the player's character as it moves through an extended game world. The instructions will help you make a partial game, which you'll need to finish designing and creating yourself. You'll also create some of your own custom assets \(sound effects and an animated sprite\) to add to your game. This practice will allow you to apply your existing knowledge of Phaser, plus show you a few more new features.

## PREP STEPS

1. Prepare a new [Phaser Game Template](../../project-references/phaser-game-template.md). Be sure to place a copy of **phaser.min.js** into the same folder that has your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
2. Download this [assets.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8MTiM_lFG9TOXpWLUVJY1NUMVk) file, and extract the file contents, which will be a folder named **assets** that has two subfolders containing 30 images and 2 sounds. Place the **assets** folder into your game template folder. \(For this game, you won't necessarily use all the provided images. It will be up to you to decide whether to use some of them.\)
3. Test your Phaser game template by previewing the HTML file online. If everything's ready to go, you should see a **solid black box** \(your blank game canvas\) on your webpage. \(If you don't get the solid black box, consult the **Troubleshooting** tips at the end of the [Phaser Game Template](../../project-references/phaser-game-template.md) page.\)

## CODING STEPS

This third practice game will be coded in 15 steps. Most of the steps will involve coding that's similar to things you did previously. However, some of the steps will introduce and explain new Phaser features.

As a reminder, all your game coding is done in your JS file \(**code.js**\).
