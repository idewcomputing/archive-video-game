# 3-4 Present Game Proposal

Your team will develop and deliver a presentation to explain your proposed game design to the class. After your presentation, the audience will provide feedback through a design critique.

Your team's presentation should briefly explain and show:

* Names and Roles of Team Members
* Design Goals for Game \(Gaming Motivations and Player Experience Goals\)
* Target Player Persona
* Working Title of Game
* Game's Premise and Setting
* Game's Characters and Story \(if applicable\)
* Game's Objective and Conflict/Challenge
* Basic Gameplay & Gameplay Progression

Be sure to incorporate visuals into your presentation, such as:

* Concept Sketches of Game World
* Concept Sketches of Characters
* Photos or Video of Paper Prototype

## 5 Tips for Giving Presentations

1. **Know your audience** — design your content and delivery for your audience's needs and expectations.
2. **Keep it simple** — be clear and concise, focus on your key message, have a clear structure from start to finish, etc.
3. **Make your content engaging** — capture your audience's interest, keep slide text limited, make numbers meaningful, use visuals and stories when possible, etc.
4. **Make your delivery engaging** — make eye contact, act confident and enthusiastic \(even if you're nervous\), use non-verbal communication, don't read slides directly, etc.
5. **Practice your presentation** — rehearse to become comfortable with your content and delivery.

## YOUR TASK

1. Develop and deliver a team presentation to explain your proposed game design.
   * Your team will have 5-7 minutes to present. Your presentation should have about 7-12 slides.
   * Each team member should contribute meaningfully by helping create the presentation slides and/or by helping deliver the verbal presentation. _Your teacher will confirm the specific expectations for participation_.
   * If a team member were to be absent, the rest of the team should still be ready to give the full presentation.
2. After your team's presentation, the audience will provide feedback through a design critique.
   * The audience has about 5 minutes for a design critique.
   * Everyone should keep in mind the [tips for giving and receiving feedback](2-5-evaluate-game-treatments.md).
   * Designate someone on your team to record notes of your critique \(so you can follow up on possible issues or improvements\)
