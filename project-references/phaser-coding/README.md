## External Resources

There are many other Phaser references, examples, and tutorials available online. Here's some you may find particularly useful:

* [Phaser CE API documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/) \(provides details for every Phaser CE command\)
* [Phaser CE code examples on Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/examples) \(Phaser 2 = Phaser CE\)
* [Phaser CE code examples on CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/AMbZgY/)
* [Phaser community tutorials on Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/news/category/tutorial) \(older examples prior to 2018 use Phaser 2, but newer examples use Phaser 3\)
* [Phaser game examples by Emanuele Feronato](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/category/phaser/) \(her older examples prior to 2018 use Phaser 2, but newer examples use Phaser 3\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**PHASER 3 VS. PHASER CE:**  Phaser 3 is the newest version of Phaser \(first released in February 2018\), which is maintained and updated by the folks at Photon Storm. Phaser CE is an open-source version of the previous Phaser 2, which is maintained and updated by the Phaser developer community.

While the API methods for Phaser 3 are similar to Phaser CE, code written for one will **not** work in the other without modification. All of the code examples in this project guidebook are based on **Phaser CE**. Eventually, this guidebook will be revised to use Phaser 3, which does offer improvements. However, in the meantime, be sure to use Phaser CE for this project.
